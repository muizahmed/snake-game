# Snake-Game
100 DoC Python Day 20 and 21 Project: Nokia's Famous Snake Game

### This Python program does the following:
1. Uses the Turtle Module from Python for most of the functionality
2. Creates a turtle object with square shape to form segments of the snake's body
3. Uses onkey method from TurtleScreen to allow user to control movement of the snake with arrow keys
4. Creates a turtle object with circle shape to make the food for snake appear on the screen
5. Uses the Random Module from Python to place food at random coordinates on the screen
6. Uses write function from Turtle Module to display score and user feedback on the screen
7. Adds to score and adds a new segment to snake's body each time the snake collides with food
8. Uses a while loop to end the game if snake collides with the far end of the screen or with any of its own segments
